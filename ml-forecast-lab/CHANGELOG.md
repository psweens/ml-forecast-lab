# Changelog

## 0.6.1

### Improvements
- Units displayed on all charts — Y-axis shows "Value (%)" or
  "Daily Cumulative (%)" based on experiment config
- Units shown on MAE and RMSE column headers in model comparison table
- Residual chart Y-axis shows units
- Daily cumulative chart resets at midnight (not running total)

## 0.6.0

### Major Features
- Covariate integration — external HA sensor data now included as
  features alongside temporal/lag features in model training
- Covariates configured in mlfl.yaml are fetched from HA history API,
  resampled to the target's interval grid, and merged into the feature
  matrix for all models
- Supports scaling (e.g. 0-100% → 0-1), transforms (log, sqrt),
  binary detection, and forward-fill alignment
- Production mode uses last known covariate value for future forecasts
- Benchmark header shows covariate count and names
- Feature matrix log shows breakdown: "33 features (31 temporal + 2 covariates)"

### Configured Covariates for Mixergy
- sensor.current_charge (scaled ×0.01): tank charge level as leading
  indicator of demand — should help predict usage spikes
- sensor.external_temperature: outdoor temperature for seasonal patterns

## 0.5.3

### New Features
- Interval / Cumulative toggle switch on holdout prediction chart
- Cumulative view shows total demand over time for comparing which
  model tracks overall accuracy best
- Smooth toggle animation with accent cyan knob

## 0.5.2

### Improvements
- LSTM and CNN epochs increased from 50 to 100 — gives models more
  time to converge through noisy loss landscapes
- Early stopping patience increased from 8 to 15 — prevents premature
  stopping when val_loss temporarily bounces up before improving
- Training still fast thanks to BPTT fix (~2s/epoch for LSTM on Pi)

## 0.5.0

### Major Features
- Full backpropagation through time (BPTT) for LSTM — all gate weights
  (input, forget, cell, output) now train properly instead of just the
  dense output layer. LSTM should now learn temporal patterns.
- Full backpropagation for CNN — conv kernel weights, biases, and residual
  connections all update during training. Includes backward pass through
  dilated causal convolutions.
- Gradient clipping (max_norm=5.0) prevents exploding gradients in both
  neural backends
- Feature names passed to all models for readable importance charts

### Bug Fixes
- LSTM and CNN predictions clipped to non-negative (prevents misleading
  chart visualisations from untrained weights)
- Reduced LSTM/CNN defaults for faster Pi training: LSTM ~3-4x faster,
  CNN ~2x faster

## 0.4.0

### New Features
- Settings page accessible from the nav bar:
  - System information: CPU cores, processor, memory usage, disk usage
  - Resource limits: configurable training CPU cores and process priority
  - Update interval, timezone, and Hailo toggle — editable from the UI
  - Per-experiment configuration overview with covariate details
  - Config file path and version info
  - Save button writes settings back to mlfl.yaml
- cpu_cores and nice_priority config options in mlfl.yaml

### Improvements
- Cleaner log format: short timestamps, no module name in console output
- Richer log viewer colours: cyan headers, green results, purple model progress
- Removed version number from footer (shown in Settings instead)

## 0.3.7

### Improvements
- Rich, informative log output inspired by Predbat:
  - Boxed startup banner with version
  - Section headers with ═══ separators for benchmark/production cycles
  - Data summary with mean, std, min, max, zero count after preprocessing
  - Per-model progress counter [1/4], [2/4] etc with ✓ on completion
  - Aligned results table with MAE, RMSE, MAPE, Time, Rank columns
  - ★ marker for best model in results table
  - Production forecast summary with per-horizon values
- Log viewer page colour-codes separators (cyan), results (green),
  best model (orange) in addition to errors/warnings

## 0.3.6

### Bug Fixes
- Tooltips now use fixed positioning with JavaScript so they don't get
  clipped by table headers or overflow containers

### Improvements
- Model Comparison tooltip includes guidance on Per-Fold Metrics
- System Status model cards now show type (Tree/Neural), speed,
  hardware acceleration support, and best-use-case for each backend
- Footer: "Created by Dr Paul W. Sweeney"

## 0.3.5

### New Features
- Info tooltips (?) on all section headers and metric columns explaining
  what each result means and how to interpret it
- Readable benchmark timestamp with relative time (e.g. "2h 15m ago")

### Improvements
- Footer updated to "Created by Dr Paul W. Sweeney"
- Mode toggle button text shortened to prevent wrapping

## 0.3.4

### New Features
- Progressive benchmark results — web UI updates after each model finishes
  its CV folds, so you see LightGBM results while LSTM is still training
- Model comparison table builds up in real-time during benchmark

## 0.3.3

### New Features
- Styled Logs page with colour-coded log levels and filter buttons (All/Info/Warning/Error)
- System Status page replacing raw JSON — shows health, experiments table, model backends, API docs
- Active nav indicator — current page highlighted with badge-style border
- Glow-pulse animation on mode badge when training is in progress
- Footer now shows version number and author credit

### Improvements
- Lab Mode stat number uses orange, Production Mode uses green to match badges
- Card footer buttons equal height and centred
- Pending status badge uses accent cyan instead of dull grey
- Run All Benchmarks button works through ingress
- Suppressed Uvicorn access logs

## 0.3.2

### New
- CHANGELOG.md for HA update screen

## 0.3.1

### New Features
- Production mode toggle button on each experiment card
- Live countdown timer for next update (e.g. "5h 58m" instead of "21510s")
- Best model / production model label on dashboard cards
- Toggle mode API endpoint

### Improvements
- Dashboard auto-refresh reduced to 60s
- Readable timestamp format

## 0.3.0

- Proper unit_of_measurement, icon, and state_class on published entities

## 0.2.4

### Bug Fixes
- Fix metric kwargs forwarding — MAE, RMSE, MAPE were failing due to unexpected y_train argument

## 0.2.3
